## Description
```
This project is a personal website for my massage therapy business. I have created this website to provide information about my service, pricing, and contact information to potential clients.

There are three links; About Me, Services and Prices, and Contact me. Included in this project are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Custom CSS Classes and Ids
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. .main-nav (found in index.html and main.css)
Class "main-nav" is the navigation bar of the website. Class "message", id "nav"(includes list items/links) are included in "main-nav" class. The CSS applied to this class adds a background color, a block display, centered alignment and padding. 

2. .message (found in index.html and main.css)
The class "message' is included in the "main-nav" class and is included in the paragraph element. "Message" is the title in the navigation area. With the usage of CSS, the font color, font-size, padding, and margin are adjusted. In Media Queries (section main.css), the class' font-size is reduced for smaller devices.

3. #nav (found in index.html and main.css)
Id "nav" was created to distinguish between the two groups of list items (navigation li and the li in the main content area titled "libenefits"). "Nav" is used to style the list items/links in the navigation area. The application of CSS adjusts the alignment to  be centered, font color, font size and makes font appear in all caps. In Media Queries (section main.css), the id's font-size is reduced for smaller devices.

4. .header (found in index.html and main.css)
The class "header" is used to style the image. The CSS styles I chose adds a border-radius,centers content, and adds padding. In Media Queries (section main.css), the image's size is reduced for smaller devices. 

5. .benefits (found in index.html and main.css)
Class "benefits" is used in conjuction with the main element. This is the main content of the page. Two additional classes are in included in "benefits" ("texttitle" and "libenefits"). "Benefits" class styles the page by adding right and left margins with the addition of bottom padding. 

6. .texttitle (found in index.html and main.css)
The class "texttitle" is added to the paragraph element and is the title for the main content. This class is centered, font color is added, and font size adjusted with CSS styles. 

7. .libenefits (found in index.html and main.css)
Class "libenefits" is used to style the ordered list element and the list items which it parents. The applied CSS adjusts font color, font size, and adds left padding. 
In Media Queries (section main.css), the class' left padding is drastically reduced to fit the screens of smaller devices.

8. .main-footer (found in index.html and main.css)
The class titled "main-footer" has been added to the footer element. The CSS applied to this class is used to adjust the font color and to display in flex, which easily centers content.


There are additional classes/ids in each link....

## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. Click the "Contact Me" link (found in index.html/main page).  There is a form found on this link. Users have the option to submit questions or comments by filling out text areas on the form. Included, is a submit button. 
I have incorporated javascript by creating a function with a click event. When the submit button is clicked an alert appears, which reads, "Thank you for your inquiries. Have a Happy Day!".
